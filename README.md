# Forkify Project
Forkify is a modern recipe application that allows users to search for recipes, view detailed ingredients, and save their favorite meals. Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it fetches recipes from an external API, providing a seamless and interactive experience. Users can also customize servings and add their own recipes.
